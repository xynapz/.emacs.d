# My Emacs Configuration

This repository contains my personal Emacs configuration. It includes UI tweaks, programming language support,
completion frameworks, version control integration, and many other enhancements.

The configuration is split across several files for readability and maintainability.

## Installation

Clone into your home directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xynapz/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
```

## Licensing

This Emacs configuration includes snippets collected from many public sources,
blogs, and documentation. All credit goes to the original authors. Some snippets
may be derived from GPL-licensed Emacs packages or community configurations.

Therefore:

 - All files in this repository containing my original work are released under
the MIT License (see the LICENSE file).

 - Any included snippets or code covered by the GPL are governed by their
respective original licenses.

 - I do not claim ownership of GPL-covered portions; they remain the property
of their original authors.

If you reuse parts of this configuration, please respect the corresponding

## System Requirement

This setup is Linux-focused.

Some modules assume external tools (e.g., Git, clang, ripgrep, vterm libs).
