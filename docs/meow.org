* Overview

Meow is a lightweight modal editing system using a *selection-first* paradigm.
Unlike Vim, you select text first, then apply an action.

| INSERT | [I]       | Text insertion             |
| MOTION | [M]       | Special modes (dired, etc) |
| KEYPAD | [K]       | Leader key commands        |

* KEYPAD for Commands

KEYPAD lets you run Emacs commands without modifiers:

| KEYPAD    | Equivalent    |
|-----------+---------------|
| =SPC x f= | =C-x C-f=     |
| =SPC x s= | =C-x C-s=     |
| =SPC x b= | =C-x b=       |
| =SPC h k= | =C-h k=       |

* Workflow Comparison

** Vim/Evil: verb → object
=ciw= = change inner word

** Meow: select → verb
=w c= = select word, then change
